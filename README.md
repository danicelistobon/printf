# _Printf

_Printf is a function developed by us, based on the printf function of the standard library <stdio.h>
It is a variadic function, which means that it receives an indeterminate number of arguments.
_Printf analyses the input, prints and returns the number of characters printed.

## Conversion specifiers

A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

```
%c   The int argument is converted to a char and resulting character 
     is written.

%s   The char* argument is expected to be a pointer to an array
     ("pointer to a string") and characters on array are written.

%i   The argument is written on base 10.

%d   The argument is written on base 10.

%%   A '%' is written. No argument is converted.
```

## Examples


```
len = _printf("Let's try to printf a simple sentence.0);

_printf("Length:[%d, %i]0, len, len);

_printf("Negative:[%d]0, -762534);

_printf("Unknown:[%r]0);

_printf("String:[%s]0, "I am a string !");
```
